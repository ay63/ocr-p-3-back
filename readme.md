# Chatop App

## Technologies Used
- `Spring Boot`: Framework for creating the application.
- `Maven`: Build tool for dependency management.
- `JPA`: For object-relational mapping with the entities.
- `AWS S3`: Integrated for storage purposes.
- `Spring Security`: For authentication and authorization.
- `Swagger/OpenAPI`: For API documentation.

# General Notes
## Key Features:
- `Separation of Concerns`: Each layer is dedicated to a specific responsibility, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
- `DTOs and Mappers`: Ensures a clear separation between the internal data model (entities) and the data exposed via APIs (DTOs).
- `Configuration Files`: Provides a centralized approach to manage application settings.
